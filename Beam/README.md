and manage metadata about your websites.

```bash
# 1. Download PHP dependencies
composer install

# 2. Download JS/HTML dependencies
yarn install

# !. use extra switch if your system doesn't support symlinks (Windows; can be enabled)
yarn install --no-bin-links

# 3. Generate assets
yarn run dev // or any other alternative defined within package.json

# 4. Run migrations
php artisan migrate
```

## [Tracker](go/cmd/tracker) (Go)

Beam Tracker serves as a tool for tracking events via API. Endpoints can be discovered via generated `/swagger.json`.

Tracker pushes events to Kafka in Influx format into `beam_events` topic. For all `/track/event` calls, Tracker also
pushes raw JSON event to its own topic based on the event *category* and *action*.

For example for payload

```json
{
  "category": "foo",
  "action": "bar"
  // ...
}
```

the event would be stored within `foo_bar` topic so everyone can subscribe to it.

#### Dependencies

- Go ^1.8
- Kafka ^0.10
- Zookeeper ^3.4
- MySQL ^5.7
    
## [Segments](go/cmd/segments) (Go)

Beam Segments serves as a read-only API for getting information about segments and users of these segments.
Endpoints can be discovered via generated `/swagger.json`.

#### Dependencies

- Go ^1.8
- InfluxDB ^1.2
- MySQL ^5.7
